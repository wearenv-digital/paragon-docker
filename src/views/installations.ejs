							<img style="border:1px solid red;" src="#" alt="Installations"><br><br> Paragon Security can implement and
							project manage all aspects of your security installation including first and second fix cable and
							equipment installation, network, electrical and civil works.<br><br>Our commissioning services will
							specify, plan and carry out a logical and systematic set of tests to demonstrate that the system fully
							meets your requirements. The systems will be tested in a logical and progressive manner in accordance with
							the test plan. After Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) of the equipment, commissioning will typically
							comprise:<br><br>
							<ul class="features-list-1 general-features">
								<li>Site acceptance tests; (SAT)</li>
								<li>Commisioning acceptance tests; (CAT)</li>
							</ul>
							<br> We will provide a detailed draft test plan prior to commencement of testing. This document will be
							subject to your approval and will include as a minimum:- <ul class="features-list-1 general-features"><br>
								<li>A statement of the methodology to adopted for the project;</li>
								<li>A logical breakdown of the system and test units, including timescales, testing milestones;</li>
								<li>Where tests are to be conducted and by whom;</li>
								<li>Details of any pre-requisites for the tests;</li>
								<li>Details of any special test equipment;</li>
								<li>Pass/fail criteria;</li>
								<li>Recording of results;</li>
								<li>Reporting of discrepancies;</li>
								<li>Correction actions.</li>
							</ul><br><br>
							<h4>Site Acceptance Tests</h4> We will perform site acceptance tests for the system prior to the system
							being accepted into service. These tests will be performed on completion of installation of the system.
							The site tests will be conducted in accordance with the agreed test scripts. <br><br>
							<h4>Commisioning Acceptance Tests </h4><br>
							<h4>Deficiency Reporting</h4><br> We will immediately report any deficiency that occurs at any stage
							during testing on an Acceptance Observation Report. <br> We will also provide a report detailing the
							deficiency and proposing a method of corrective action. This report will address the following as a
							minimum: <br><br>
							<ul class="features-list-1 general-features">
								<li> The nature of the deficiency. </li>
								<li>The impact of the deficiency on the ability of the system to meet the requirements of the Statement
									of Requirements.</li>
								<li>The impact on the deficiency on the project timescales.</li>
							</ul>
							<br> A proposed course of corrective action to be undertaken by us to correct the deficiency. An
							implementation timescale for the corrective actions to be undertaken will be subject to the agreement with
							yourselves. <br>
							<h4>Acceptance Package</h4><br> The acceptance package will include as a minimum: - <ul
								class="features-list-1 general-features"><br>
								<li>A definition of the system/equipment being accepted by reference to the original specification,
									proposal drawings, etc.</li>
								<li>A complete inventory of the items deliverable against the satisfactory completion of tests;</li>
								<li>A detailed system configuration;</li>
								<li>Certified copies of the tests scripts;</li>
