							<img style="border:1px solid red;" src="#" alt="Security Risk Assessment"><br><br> A security risk assessment is essential to understand the threats that could damage your building, people or brand. We
							therefore first need to know what your vulnerabilities are and how a threat could exploit them.<br><br>The following elements will be considered:<br>
							<strong>Assets:</strong><br>
							These are the things we want to protect, such as people, property, brand reputation, and information, an organisation
							cannot function if its assets are comprised <br>
							<strong>Threats:</strong><br>
							These are what we protect against, they aim to exploit our vulnerability to reach our Assets. <br>
							<strong>vulnerability:</strong><br>
							These are the weakness in our protection of assets. They are what threats aim to exploit. Vulnerabilities and weakness
							can be strengthened to mitigate against potential threats. <br>
							<strong>Risks:</strong><br>
							This is about potential for threat and vulnerability to interact. It is the potential for damage, loss, and destruction
							to your Assets. Risk can have treatment methods applied. <br><br>
							For a successful security risk assessment, we need to identify what the assets are and how your organisation interacts
							with them. It is important to understand both people and culture that surrounds assets. <br><br>
							Paragon Security can provide a comprehensive security risk assessment that looks at your assets, vulnerabilities and
							risks. <br><br>
							Typically, the Security Risk Assessment comprises:
							<ul class="features-list-1 general-features"><br>
								<li>Risk identification and analysis.</li>
								<li>Threat and vulnerability assessment.</li>
								<li>Review of site and facility security.</li>
								<li>Analysis of crime data.</li>
								<li>Review of compliance</li>
								<li>Facility operating procedures assessment</li>
								<li>Evaluation of physical, electronic and architectural security systems, together with the relevant policies and
								procedures.</li>
								<li>Security management and personnel analysis.</li>
							</ul> <br><br>
							By providing security risk assessments on an existing site, or by working with building design professionals on a new
							project. we can recommended solutions that will minimise or transfer risk and mitigate against threats identified. <br><br>
							We conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment, and then develop conceptual security design ideas either through
							site visits or analysis of architectural drawings. <br><br>
							We the produce a report, highlighting all the important information in an easy to understand format with diagrams and
							images detailing the issues bespoke to your site. Without a security risk assessment, it is impossible to protect what
							is most important to you.
